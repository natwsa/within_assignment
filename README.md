My frequent use of the PATH (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) inspired me to build a model that could predict the longterm average traffic of a given PATH station. Such predictions are obviously useful for choosing new station locations and planning around station closures, but building an effective model challenges typical ML approaches due to the extremely low number of potential data-points; there are only 13 stations, 7 in  New Jersey and 6 across the Hudson in New York. On the other end of the problem, there exists a vast wealth of potential feature variables. Transit networks, population demographics, and myriad other specific attributes of particular locations are not easy to wrangle into quantifiable, structured data. Indeed, the hardest part of completing this task was intelligently curating a small set of easily calculable feature inputs.  

I ultimately achieved the best results training a random forest model on the following feature variables: proximity to nearest PATH station, number of PATH lines along which the station lies (PATH has three different lines), number of neighboring PATH stations, number of connections to other transit systems (MTA, NJ Transit, etc.), and side of the Hudson River. All data was scraped from the publically available [PATH website](https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/about/stats.html). A tree-based based model is the most natural approach to a problem with a tiny number of datapoints and tabular data, and I was able to reach a mean absolute error of ~2500 (for context, the mean daily traffic was 12,500, and a dummy model that always predicts the mean average traffic had a mean absolute error of ~5000). By far the most important variable was proximity to closest station; it turns out that a significant amount of geospatial network information (very hard to feed to a model) can be preserved with a single, easily calculable integer (very easy to feed to a model)! See the images below for more details.

A natural next step would be the enrich my dataset by considering train stations in other transit systems, such as the MTA. I could also try to generate more sophisticated geospatial data features or consider external factors such as population density, car ownership rates, income levels, etc. (note that one reason I did not use such analysis initially was that much census data is gathered at the insufficiently granular county level, whereas I needed to perform analysis at the 'tract' level to differentiate between stations in the same county). Adding datapoints from a transit system before and after a station opens / closes will be particularly useful for determining which features best capture the graphical relationship of a transit network. My model (like the data upon which it relies) is ultra-lightweight, and its users don't require real-time interaction, so scalability and latency are of no concern; the model can freely be (re)trained and invoked locally, at a user's discretion.
